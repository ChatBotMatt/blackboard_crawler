# blackboard_crawler
###Small app that grabs all pdf files from a specified Blackboard link

This should now work with most any course/degree scheme some slight changes would be needed as I cannot have access to all other courses' blackboard to test. 
Also for ease of use it would be nice if a GUI was added, I'll try adn do this in the future after more features are added.
